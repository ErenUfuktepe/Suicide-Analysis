# Suicide-Analysis

## Introduction

Suicide is death caused by injuring oneself with the intent to die. The World Health Organisation estimates that each year approximately one milloin people die from suicide, which represent a global mortality rate of one death every 40 seconds and It is predicted that by 2020 the rate of death will increase to one every 20 seconds. If we could analyze people who are more susceptible to suicide, we may able to prevent some suicide actions before it happens or we can take some precautions.

I found this dataset for one of my courses to analyze. After analyzing the data, I found it is interesting because suicides are increasing in the world and we need to stop this increase. In this notebook, I will try to analyze data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/who-suicide-statistics"> Kaggle</a> to see effects on suicides by country, gender, age, and population.
